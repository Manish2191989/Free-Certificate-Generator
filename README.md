"HOW TO USE THIS REPOSITORY CODE"
(Certificate-Generator)

## Steps for executing the code

Step-1: Just design your certificate
For your assistance, the template of both participation and organising team certificates in PPT editable format is already provided in the folder "docs". You just need to save it as PDF and get it converted into .jpg file through online free tools

Step-2: Keep .jpeg of certificate in the same folder

Step-3: Determine the coordinates for the text to be printed on the certificate
In order to locate the coordinates in your generated .jpg certificate, simply open the .jpg file in paint file edit mode and move the mouse cursor to the location for text in the certificate in order to know the exact coordinate of the text to be printed. 

Step-4: Keep the TTF file in the same folder
TTF stands for True Type Font. It helps to add font style to the text to be printed in certificate. In this code, I have used "Times New Roman" Font Style. For other font style, you can simply search online, say "download font ttf arial".
  

Step-5: keep the .xlsx file in the same folder
Note that the Excel File shall neither contain any text in Merge Column/Row format nor any text containing dot operator. Otherwise, this code will not genrate any certificate. A sample Excel Sheet of Participant and Organizing Team is given in this example. 

Step-6: Make sure:
(i). If you want to execute this code on your local system, you must have Python Software and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. To make the things simple, you can simply download two software - Python and Anaconda (containing Jupyter Notebook) that are easily available online on their official website. Both are open source and free to download and use.

(ii). If you want to execute this code online, simply upload this code unzipped folder in your Google Drive and Execute the code on Google Colab available in Google Drive.  

Step-7: Finally:
(i). Make sure to empty the folder of participants and organising_team before executing the code. The code will not generate the certificate in the respective folders if they are not empty.
(ii). Execute the "Certificate Generator.ipynb" file in Jupyter Notebook to get the desired output.
